# 4-project-for-ML

This project focuses on utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique for data analysis and dimensionality reduction. It is divided into two parts: the first part utilizes Fashion-MNIST data to illustrate the application of PCA in analyzing high-dimensional data, then reducing its dimensions to simplify complexity and facilitate classification or analysis. The quality of dimensionality reduction is analyzed, and the performance of the model used for classification is evaluated after applying PCA.

In the second part, real-world data related to car prices in Moldova is used, where the same process of dimensionality reduction and data analysis is applied in a simplified manner. A model is trained for classification or analysis after PCA is applied, and its performance is compared with the model using the original data.

Overall, this project serves as a practical lesson in understanding how to use PCA for data analysis and dimensionality reduction, and how it can lead to data simplification and improve the performance of analytical and classification models.
